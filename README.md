How It Works:

When the program starts, it shows a menu of options.

You choose an action by typing the corresponding number.

For adding items, you enter:

Item name

Price

Stock quantity

For changing the price, you enter the item name and the new price.

For updating stock, you enter the item name and the updated stock quantity.

For viewing inventory, the program prints all items in a table format.

The program keeps running until you choose to exit.
